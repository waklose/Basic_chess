# chess-program
This is a simple chess program with basic graphics.
It was coded in VS Code in the summer of 2020 (after my first year of study).
It was meant as a fun challange and a program that i could use to play chess with a friend offline.
I coded alone and did not focus on making the best possible and most efficient code. Just something that worked.
